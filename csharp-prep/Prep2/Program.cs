Overview: Write a program that determines the letter grade for a course according to the following scale:
    A >= 90
    B >= 80
    C >= 70
    D >= 60
    F < 60
Assignment: Start by completing the core requirements, then when that part is complete, if you have time, see if 
you can complete some of the stretch challenges as well. Please work through the requirements in order rather than 
jumping ahead to more complicated steps, to ensure that everyone is following the concepts.
Core Requirements: 
    1. Ask the user for their grade percentage, then write a series of if-elif-else statements to print out the 
    appropriate letter grade. (At this point, you'll have a separate print statement for each grade letter in the 
    appropriate block.)
    2. Assume that you must have at least a 70 to pass the class. After determining the letter grade and printing 
    it out. Add a separate if statement to determine if the user passed the course, and if so display a message to 
    congratulate them. If not, display a different message to encourage them for next time.
    3. Change your code from the first part, so that instead of printing the letter grade in the body of each if, 
    elif, or else block, instead create a new variable called letter and then in each block, set this variable to 
    the appropriate value. Finally, after the whole series of if-elif-else statements, have a single print statement
    that prints the letter grade once.
Stretch Challenge:
    1. Add to your code the ability to include a "+" or "-" next to the letter grade, such as B+ or A-. For each 
    grade, you'll know it is a "+" if the last digit is >= 7. You'll know it is a minus if the last digit is < 3 
    and otherwise it has no sign.
    After your logic to determine the grade letter, add another section to determine the sign. Save this sign into 
    a variable. Then, display both the grade letter and the sign in one print statement.
    2. Recognize that there is no A+ grade, only A and A-. Add some additional logic to your program to detect this 
    case and handle it correctly.
    3. Similarly, recognize that there is no F+ or F- grades, only F. Add additional logic to your program to detect 
    these cases and handle them correctly.
